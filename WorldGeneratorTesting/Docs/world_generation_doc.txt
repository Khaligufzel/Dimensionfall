RANDOM SEED-BASED WORLD GENERATION

Regions then individual chunks


https://auburn.github.io/FastNoiseLite/ FastNoiseLite viewer, very useful.

1. Biomes (should be very big):
- temperate (green)
- hot (red)
- cold (blue)

2. Elevation (should be big)
- flat
- ocean
- hills
- mountains



3. Regions:
- village/town/city/metropolis,
- forest
- swamp

4. Individual POIs

5. Connections (roads, bridges, pathways etc)


Settings and mechanics for Biomes, Elevation and Regions:

Min size X and Y
Max size X and Y
Density? Probably from 0-100, where 100 will be fully filled?
Shapes? 

Using Cellular noise type for biomes (Return type cell value, so there is not a lot of random scattered biome tiles)

Steps:

1. Fill a big area with one basic terrain type (grass for example)
2.
