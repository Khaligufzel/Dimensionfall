class_name OvermapManager
extends Node

# This script manages the overmap, which defines the terrain making up the game world.
# It is part of the Helper singleton and can be accessed by Helper.overmap_manager
# It keeps track of the player's coordinate and which chunks are in the area
# It has algorithms to add and remove chunks from the area
# It has helper functions to manipulate the overmap

# This overmap manager only creates and manipulates data
# It creates a grid of cells based on map noise and decides what map goes where
# This creates as set of coordinates and map locations. Each map is as large
# as the chunk_size, which is 32x32x21 blocks. Each block is 1x1, so the chunks are 32 apart
# Therefore, if we know the player's location, we can calculate which chunk he is in.

# There are multiple coordinate systems that interact with the overmap_manager
# 1. The overmap uses coordinates like (-1,-1), (-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) for map_cell coordinates
# 	These coordinates are absolute and mark their global position on the overmap
# 2. The overmap gui also uses this coordinate system, but saves them in chunks of 16
#   Which is why we need translation from the overmap gui to the overmap data
# 3. The LevelGenerator.gd also uses this system for loading and unloading chunks
# 4. Then there's the overmap meta positioning. This is used for OvermapGrids The overmap has large chunks of grid_width
#   by grid_height, which holds 10000 cells. This set is what's saved and loaded to disk

# We keep a reference to the level_generator, which holds the chunks
# The level generator will register itself to this variable when it's ready
